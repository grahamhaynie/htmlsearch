# Project Title

This program is a GUI for a very basic html parser. The user can select an html element to search for and input a website url, and the results are displayed. The tkinter, urlib, and re libraries are implemented for learning purposes.

## Future developement

* Improve the regular expression used to reduce clutter
* Add a search for custom search where the user can input an html element to search for
* Add the ability to search for embedded elements, where the user selects the elements and the order to search for them
